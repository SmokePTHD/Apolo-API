# GRAPHQL-API

Apolo-API is a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, designed to provide a simple starting point for developers looking to learn and work with GraphQL. This project serves as an introduction to GraphQL concepts and is a part of my **Professional Aptitude Project (PAP)**. The goal is to showcase how to build a real-world API using GraphQL, Apollo Server, and best practices for structuring your API.

## Features

- Basic setup of Apollo Server
- GraphQL API to query data
- Example of a simple data model and resolvers

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (or Yarn)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmokePTHD/GraphQL-API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Apolo-API/TestPAP
   ```

   or, to see the class that I saw

   ```bash
   cd GraphQL-API/Class
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   Using npm:

   ```

   or, using yarn:
